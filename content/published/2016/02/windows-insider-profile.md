I've been a Microsoft Insider ever since its inception, and I have a habit of sending detailed bug reports and patches if I have the time to pretty much most of the open source software I tend to use for over a few hours. Keeping with that habit, there's quite a lot feedback that I had submitted early on (At the time of writing this, I probably have around a hundred feedbacks already). And not long ago, the Insider Hub app got a bunch of Achievements (a potential attempt at a basic *gamification* to encourage participation). And well, seems like as of a few days ago, I've gotten all of the so-called **"Achievements"**. Ha! (I can't believe I'm actually writing about this, but hey, it's fun and easy).

I generally tend to live on the bleeding-edge. Most of my systems are almost always on the fast-ring, and run pre-release software. So, apart from the usual place I call home (`GitHub`), Microsoft Feedback has off-late *become a kinda of this tiny boat away from home* that I go to for Microsoft's closed source softwares. Sometimes I wish they'd just use GitHub, but understandably, this is for everyone and the conduct in the Feedback app is.. well, different - **redundant but concise, non-technical but hits the nail on UX, quite unrefined but unavoidably hilarious at times**.
