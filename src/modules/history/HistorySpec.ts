    Raw query string including after "?" (Does not include the question mark). Parsed qs 
    is not a part of this by design. Its very easy to use one of the external libs to do so, 
    and it adds pointless complexity doing it here efficiently and providing multiple 
    contexts. (Where to cache the object without parsing it for every context? Caching in root
    context is one way, but doesn't address if the listener chain modifies qs. Caching in each ctx
    addresses that, but incurs inefficiency. So, its best to leave that responsibility to the
    app to do it in a manner that's most suitable for the app.)
    The app can even have a listener that attaches a attaches a query object to the context.
    PS: Always parse on-demand and cache query on access. Avoid parsing it unnecessarily.
    Tip: Use accessor props
