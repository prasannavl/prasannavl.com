{"name":"PVL-StockPlus - Custom ROM for Motorola Defy Plus","date":"2012-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","url":"2012/04/pvl-stockplus-custom-rom-for-motorola_05.html","tags":[],"content":"So, after staying at CM for a long time, I came across the recent release of Motorola's ROM. And I must admit, for the first time, I was quite impressed. It was snappy, fast and stable. So, I guess I came to a point where I wanted everything to just work instead of hovering around nightlies, making this stock version a perfect base to rectify Motorola's shortcomings, like the God-awful transitions, the complex and ugly loading icon, and well, root, busybox, memory optimizations and all the other performance goodies. I'm a fan of keeping things simple and elegant, rather than complicating things unnecessarily. And I thought, I would share it this time, for those who prefer to use a stable stock version but will all the goodies. So, here : PVL-StockPlus.\r\n\r\n**Base:** DEFYPLUS_U3_4.5.1-134_DFP-231-AsiaRetail\r\n**Languages:** en_US, en_GB, fr_FR, it_IT, es_ES, es_US, de_DE, de_AT, nl_NL, zh_CN, vi_VN, tl_PH, th_TH, id_ID.\r\n\r\n**Compatible Devices:** Motorola Defy Plus (MB526), Motorola Defy (MB525+, MB525 - Bayer camera module only, devices with green lens is not supported)\r\n\r\n**Core Additions:**\r\n\r\nRooted.\r\nAdded Busybox.\r\nAdded latest Bootmenu.\r\nAdded 720p video recording and playback.\r\nAdded panorama mode.\r\nAdded init.d support.\r\nAdded official Motorola's full version of QuickOffice instead of Lite.\r\nAutomatic zip-align on boot.\r\nAdded ramscript.\r\nEnabled Multi-touch support upto 10 points.

(Info: 720p uses generic MPEG4 Part-2 encoding while others use H264 (Part-10 AVC) as frame-rate with 720p using H264 is too low, although it provides better quality. Edit /system/build.prop if you wish to change that.)\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\n\r\n\r\n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_uIDBm9ReK0/T3y5llUcL4I/AAAAAAAAAIg/dLcS8y8h1Lc/s320/Screenshot1.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_uIDBm9ReK0/T3y5llUcL4I/AAAAAAAAAIg/dLcS8y8h1Lc/s1600/Screenshot1.jpg)\r\n\r\n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2SO1pSNyAuo/T3y5nUf2QNI/AAAAAAAAAIo/IH-1OA2Jn9s/s320/Screenshot2.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2SO1pSNyAuo/T3y5nUf2QNI/AAAAAAAAAIo/IH-1OA2Jn9s/s1600/Screenshot2.png)\r\n\r\n[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--4RgtNQRnMY/T3y5o8upjrI/AAAAAAAAAIw/ECc7-E0q2go/s320/Screenshot3.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--4RgtNQRnMY/T3y5o8upjrI/AAAAAAAAAIw/ECc7-E0q2go/s1600/Screenshot3.png)\r\n\r\n[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Nw0A4u00yUM/T3zi8P5P5QI/AAAAAAAAAI8/wa23Bj2mo_0/s320/Screenshot4.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Nw0A4u00yUM/T3zi8P5P5QI/AAAAAAAAAI8/wa23Bj2mo_0/s1600/Screenshot4.png)\r\n\r\n**How to Install:**\r\n\r\n1\\.
