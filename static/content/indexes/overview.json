But I'm sure to come up with something for this site, sooner or later. Until then, its just an empty cup waiting to be filled..\r\n\r\nAnd cheers to all my MIT 2007 batch-mates! 4 Unforgettable years of our lives! For all that we know, could be the best in many ways. Nevertheless, here's to a more exciting future and an incredible journey ahead!

May it be the tiny little scripts, softwares tests or personal reviews, or a project that I work on, its great to learn, but I must make time to share what I learn! Well, if it wasn't for all those tutorials and blogs that ended up in my Google results years ago, I probably wouldn't have learnt what I have. My primary source of knowledge was the internet since my childhood. I was one of those kids - \"Mom, why are these books clogging up our home?, we have Internet!\", \"Mom, why do you want to go to the railway station for a simple ticket? we have Internet!\", \"Grandpa, why do you keep tuning that radio, we have Internet!\". Well, gone "},{"name":"Automate your TV show downloads","date":"2011-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","url":"2011/12/automate-your-tv-show-downloads.html","tags":[],"content":"So, I've become quite a TV show addict lately. I found myself checking websites for new episodes often, and if available, download and add it to my Torrents download list. The same exact process. Should write a short program to do that, I thought. But never happened.\r\n\r\nAnd it all changed recently, as I had sat down for food waiting for my order. I had just discovered Scripting for Android a while back - I was able to write and run Python code off my phone. Pretty cool. And I happened to overhear a conversation about the latest episode of House. Hmmm.\r\n\r\nAnd so I started typing out a script to check for TV shows.

And I must admit, for the first time, I was quite impressed. It was snappy, fast and stable. So, I guess I came to a point where I wanted everything to just work instead of hovering around nightlies, making this stock version a perfect base to rectify Motorola's shortcomings, like the God-awful transitions, the complex and ugly loading icon, and well, root, busybox, memory optimizations and all the other performance goodies. I'm a fan of keeping things simple and elegant, rather than complicating things unnecessarily.
