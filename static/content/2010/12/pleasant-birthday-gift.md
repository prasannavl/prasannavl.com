A Pleasant Birthday Gift!
===

Well, thanks to two of my best buddies, Prassanna Ganesh and Abhinit Kumar, I now have a website under my name.

I'm quite busy to do anything with it at the moment. But I'm quite sure to come up with something for this site, sooner or later. Until then, its just an empty cup waiting to be filled..

And cheers to all my MIT 2007 batch-mates! 4 Unforgettable years of our lives! For all that we know, could be the best in many ways. Nevertheless, here's to a more exciting future and an incredible journey ahead! Cheers!

Thanks again to Abhinit and RPG.
